Part I
	Highlight square going through the square itself
		Let the square highlight other cubes
		1 cursor per square
		Screw static batching for now I guess.  We can set the color by copying the material

	Assign pieces to players
	Player makes move action
	Get valid moves for one piece
	Get all valid moves for a player

	The game
		Moves, somehow
		Start via ready button?
		For now, AI player that picks random available moves while it can make a move.
		On game complete, do something silly
		Need to show messages from the game manager
