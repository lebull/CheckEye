Open Issues:
	Right now, the spawning is derped.  I think the BoardPieces are spawning BEFORE boardSquares (no good :c);
	Further testing has confirmed that the boardSQUARES are being instantiated AFTER the game tries to set up the pieces.
		Add a todo if you try to move a gamepiece to nil.

Part I
	DONE
		Highlight square going through the square itself
			Let the square highlight other cubes
			1 cursor per square
			Screw static batching for now I guess.  We can set the color by copying the material

	Assign pieces to players
	Player makes move action
	80% Get valid moves for one piece
	80% Get all valid moves for a player

	The game
		Moves, somehow
		Start via ready button?
		For now, AI player that picks random available moves while it can make a move.
		On game complete, do something silly
		Need to show messages from the game manager
