VR Checkers Game

Current Goals:

Play a full game against an ai and play again
Create a game enviornment optimized for VR
Port to GearVR
Stretch Goals:

Network against other players (likely locally hosted, may look into Photon for their nice lobby/matchmaking support)
-Voice communication would be a fun issue, but I won't worry about it for now.
-I WILL worry about creating some sort of avatar for your opponent.
More Stretch Goals:

Chess
Chinese Checkers
Maybe a card game? Spades would be great!
